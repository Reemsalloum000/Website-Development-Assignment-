# Website-Development-Assignment
This project is part of my practical training at Grids Apps, where I developed a fully functional website using HTML5 and CSS3. The website consists of 10+ pages, including Home, About, Contact, Services, Portfolio, Album, Privacy Policy, Return Policy, and Terms &amp; Conditions. ðŸš€
